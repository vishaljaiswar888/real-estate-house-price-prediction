## Real Estate House Price Prediction Machine Learning Model
- This is end-to-end Machine Learning Model which predicts the price of the house as per the inputs given by the user on the webpage. Say, Location, BHK, Number of Bathrooms and the Area in Square Feets.

- Interface is made using pythonâ€™s flask web framework.

## Models used
- Linear Regression - (82.55% r2_score)

- Lasso - (81.46% r2_score)

- Ridge - (81.46% r2_score)

- As per the above r2_scores, Linear Regression and Ridge where performing a bit better than Lasso. That's why for build the web framework I chose Ridge ML Model with 82.46% r2_score.
